# Voiced Telos

Gives Telos a voice. For _immmersion_.

## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Voiced Telos copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/VoicedTelos/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Voice of Seren to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Features

- Gives Telos a voice! That's all.

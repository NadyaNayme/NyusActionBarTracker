# Nyu's Action Bar Tracker

Track your actions as you use them.

## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Action Bar Tracker copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/NyusActionBarTracker/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Voice of Seren to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.

## Early Access

This plugin is considered to be in Early Access. This means it may be buggy, take up more CPU than necessary as it has not been optimized yet, and may change between uses due to changes in the code. Please join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KJ2SgWyJFF) if you would like to leave feedback or make feature quests.

## Known Limitations

- Can't track multiple highlights at once so if you press multiple keybinds at once (eg. bridding) then only the top, left most action will be tracked
- Can't track actions that do not get highlighted when used (eg. Dive/Bladed Dive, Magma Tempest when targetted, possibly others)
- GCD rolling timer partially obstructs view of some actions. Please consider this a feature to learn about early/late inputs. :)
- Bad inputs (eg. using an ability that is already on cooldown) displays the ability as-is with its cooldown timer. Please consider this a feature and stop pressing bad inputs. :)

Of these known limitations the only one that might possibly be fixed in the future is the first issue of multiple highlights.
